# Jigsaw Decrypter

This is a Jigsaw decrypter written for JadeCTF 2022. I implemented it after finding a lot of broken software and repos.

## Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py input_file output_file
```

## Credits
My friends for helping me with the decryption algorithm and the CTF organizers for the challenge.
